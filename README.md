# webapp-spock

This is a Haskell version of
[Flask webapp](https://github.com/xor-xor/webapp_flask) that I wrote
some time ago. It is pretty basic - I use it as a playground for
tinkering with different concepts that come with Haskell and
[Spock](https://github.com/agrafix/Spock) framework. I'm going to
extend and polish it a bit it in the future (use `persistent` and
`esqueleto` instead of raw SQL queries, `Web.Spock.Safe` instead of
`Web.Spock.Simple`, add some more tests and some additional
functionality etc.).

In order to use it, you need `postgresql` server running. I've
included `db_dump.sql` which creates necessary tables and fills them
with some data (you need to manually create database `employees`
first, though).

This app uses `stack` for fetching dependencies, building binaries,
testing and executing them - please refer to
[Stack's docs](http://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README.html) if
you are not familiar with this tool. Remember to set correct paths for
`postgresql` and `zlib` libs/headers in `stack.yaml`
(with `extra-include-dirs` and `extra-lib-dirs`)!

After setting everything up , you just need to edit `app.cfg` file and
fill it with credentials for your database and this app. By default,
it will run on port 8000 (which of course can be changed too).
